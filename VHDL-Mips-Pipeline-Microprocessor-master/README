This is my Implementation of a Mips Pipeline Processor in VHDL. 
It has the five stages of a microprocessor: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execution
(EX), memory access and write (MEM) e write back (WB).
The code has a separeted file for each component in the processor.

Note that it might not be a perfect implementation!

The script should be executed in the current (project root) directory, due to path requirements.
